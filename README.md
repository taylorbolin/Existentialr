# Existentialr

### App Info:
Anyone with a beating heart can create an account and log onto Existentialr to come to terms with their mortality. Once logged in, a Existentialr member simply has to input their date of birth and sex and we'll tell you (based on US averages) how much more time you have left to live and what percentage of your life you've already completed. Afterwards, users are free to leave comments about their feelings on the comments page.

### Teachnologies Utilized:

### User Story and Wireframes:
Existentialr arose from the need to gain perspective on your life, and just how precious every moment is. Also death is a lot less scary when you add some humor to it. Wireframes of this project can be found here: http://i.imgur.com/rJU2qe7.png

### Moving Forward:
In it's current state, comments on Existentialr are anonymous and cannot be edited or deleted. I'd like to have each comment be associated with a user name, and potentially the ability for a user to delete their own comments but not those of others. 
Otherwise, I've seen some jQuery/JS effects that would give the percentage of life completed to appear in a pie or donut chart with some animation effects. I think there are flashier, more entertaining/interesting ways to display that data.
